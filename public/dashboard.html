I've created a comprehensive enhancement to the Finla.ai transcription system with advanced audio analysis features. Here's what I've added:

## Key Features Added:

### 1. **Enhanced Transcription API** (`app/api/transcribe/route.ts`)
- **Multi-service support**: Gemini, OpenAI Whisper, and Deepgram Nova-3
- **Advanced analysis**: Sentiment analysis, speaker diarization, topic detection
- **Medical content detection**: Specialized medical terminology extraction
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Automatic speech/silence detection

### 2. **Database Integration** (`app/api/recordings/route.ts`)
- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete recordings
- **Advanced search**: Filter by medical content, service used, date ranges
- **Pagination support**: Handle large datasets efficiently
- **Metadata storage**: Audio format, duration, confidence scores

### 3. **Recording Management** (`app/api/recordings/[id]/route.ts`)
- **Individual recording access**: Detailed view of each transcription
- **Edit capabilities**: Update titles, transcriptions, and notes
- **Analytics integration**: Link to speaker and segment analysis

### 4. **Enhanced Database Schema**
The system now uses the complete database schema with:
- **recordings**: Main transcription data with enhanced metadata
- **speakers**: Speaker diarization results
- **segments**: Detailed time-stamped analysis
- **analytics**: Comprehensive insights and summaries

## Advanced Analysis Features:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional tone detection across segments
2. **Speaker Diarization**: Multi-speaker identification and labeling
3. **Topic Detection**: Automatic extraction of key themes and subjects
4. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: Speech vs. silence segmentation
5. **Medical Content Analysis**: Specialized healthcare terminology detection

## API Endpoints:

- `POST /api/transcribe` - Process audio with advanced analysis
- `GET /api/recordings` - List all recordings with pagination
- `GET /api/recordings/[id]` - Get specific recording details
- `PUT /api/recordings/[id]` - Update recording information
- `DELETE /api/recordings/[id]` - Delete recording and associated data

The system maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new analysis capabilities. All sensitive operations are server-side only, ensuring security and performance.
